# Description
This repository is a collection of files from when I was learning Python, following the IBM Python for Data Science course. The content can be explained as follows:

- "Basics" .py files reasonably cover the breadth of basic Python use; _data structures, OOP, NumPy and some simple API usage_.
- "evals.csv" is a dataset collected from the University of Texas containing students' evaluation of courses and the "beauty" of the professors that taught them.
- "Statistics texas evals..." .py covers all of the **statistical analysis** and **data visualisation** methods learnt (and performed on the evals.csv dataset) into one neat program.
